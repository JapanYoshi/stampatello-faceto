    Stampatello Faceto is a block-script handwriting font with broad multilingual support spanning Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. It started as a project to create a modern handwriting font for Ancient Greek, but has since expanded to include a diverse character set including Vietnamese and Bulgarian Cyrillic. It is based on the handwriting of the designer using a felt-tip pen.

<p>
    The two-story lowercase “g”, the two-storey lowercase “a”, and the old-style numerals are rare for a handwriting font. There are alternate letterforms as OpenType features, including single-storey “a”, single-storey “g”, lining numerals, and a familiar single-stroke version of capital omega “Ω” (which is written with a raised O with an underline as it is commonly written in handwriting).
</p>
<p>
    The Cyrillic letterforms blend block-script versions with some cursive features.

    Stampatello Faceto is Italian for “facetious block script”.
