# Stampatello Faceto

Stampatello Faceto is a block-script handwriting font with massive multilingual support spanning Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. It started as a project to create a modern handwriting font for Ancient Greek, but has since expanded to include a diverse character set including Vietnamese and Bulgarian Cyrillic. It is based on the handwriting of the designer using a felt-tip pen, with some creative liberties and beautification added in.

The Cyrillic letterforms blend block-script versions with some cursive features.

Stampatello Faceto is Italian for “facetious block script”.
